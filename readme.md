## WordPress Countdown Timer Shortcode

A simple shortcode to create a countdown timer. Takes a date that can be interpreted by javascripts Date.parse() method. Learn more about what can be passed into that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse#date_time_string_format).

Like so:

```
[countdown date="2022-12-31T16:00:00" /]
```

That'll create a countdown to December 31, 2022 at 4pm.
